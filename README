#Car & Pedestrian Detector

A computer vision project using OpenCV to detect cars and pedestrians in images and videos.

Dependencies:

- OpenCV (cv2)
- Cascade classifiers for cars and pedestrians (cars.xml and haarcascade_fullbody.xml)

Usage:

1. Install OpenCV and import the necessary dependencies.
2. Place the cars.xml and haarcascade_fullbody.xml files in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script using Python (e.g., python (link unavailable)).
4. The script will detect cars and pedestrians in the input image and video files.

Input Files:

- cars_image.webp (image file for testing)
- moving_cars.mp4 (video file for testing)

Output:

- Detected cars and pedestrians are highlighted in the output video stream.

Key Bindings:

- Press 'Q' or 'q' to quit the program.

Note:

- Adjust the cascade classifier files and the detection parameters as needed for optimal performance.
